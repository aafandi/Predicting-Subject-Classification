# Predicting-Subject-Classification
The various subject classifications of articles/papers in mathematics is very nuanced. 

In fact, on the first page of [this pdf](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2020.pdf), you can find the most recent verions of the AMS math classification list.

Most practicing mathematicians are relatively accurate at glancing at a title, and guessing the subject classification. 

The question we would like to answer: can we use machine learning/NLP to train a model that *performs better* than human mathematicians at guessing the classification?

We used data scraped from the Mathematics Genalogy Project as training data.
